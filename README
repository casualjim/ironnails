IronNails
=========

IronNails is a framework inspired by the Rails and rucola frameworks. It offers a rails-like way of developing applications with IronRuby and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
This framework uses the pattern Model - ViewModel - View - Controller (M-VM-V-C). It should be able to run on both WPF and Silverlight.
The idea is that the views can be created using a design tool like Blend for example and just save that xaml as is. The designer should not need to use anything else than drag and drop to create a GUI design. The behaviors are then added to the view by using predefined behaviors in the framework or by defining your own behavior.
The framework then generates a proxy for the view which will be used to transparently wire up the commands in the behaviors to controller actions. 

You are now able to write the following code for a controller:

class MyController < IronNails::Controller::Base
  
  view_action :show_message, :triggers => :my_button do
    MessageBox.show "This is the great message from a block"
  end
  
  view_action :change_color, :triggers => { :element => :my_text_block, :event => :mouse_enter }
  view_action :reset_color, :triggers => { :element => :my_text_block, :event => :mouse_leave } do |view|
    view.my_text_block.foreground = :black.to_brush
  end
  
  view_object :people, Person.find_all
    
  def change_color(view)
    view.my_text_block.foreground = :red.to_brush
  end
  
  
end

Help is wanted for implementing the following items.

* RSpec stories
* Predefined behaviors
* Better xaml integration
* Encapsulation of automatic refreshing of models.

IronNails
=========

IronNails is a framework inspired by the Rails and rucola frameworks. It offers a rails-like way of developing applications with IronRuby and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
This framework uses the pattern Model - ViewModel - View - Controller (M-VM-V-C). It should be able to run on both WPF and Silverlight.
The idea is that the views can be created using a design tool like Blend for example and just save that xaml as is. The designer should not need to use anything else than drag and drop to create a GUI design. The behaviors are then added to the view by using predefined behaviors in the framework or by defining your own behavior.
The framework then generates a proxy for the view which will be used to transparently wire up the commands in the behaviors to controller actions. 

You should be able to define a controller a little like this (doesn't work yet and will most likely change in the future):

class MyController < IronNails::Controllers::Base

  view_object :some_model, Model.find_all

  view_action :some_action, :target => :my_button, :action => :some_action_implementation

  def some_action
    # code here
  end

end
